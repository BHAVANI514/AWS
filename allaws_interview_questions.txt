Common interview questions + answers

We’ll start with AWS Basics (the foundation).

🔹 Topic 1: AWS Basics
📌 Theory

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud computing platform providing on-demand services.

Cloud service models:

IaaS → Infrastructure as a Service (EC2, S3, VPC).

PaaS → Platform as a Service (Elastic Beanstalk, RDS).

SaaS → Software as a Service (WorkMail, Chime).

Global infrastructure:

Region → A geographical location (e.g., us-east-1).

Availability Zone (AZ) → Data centers inside a region (e.g., us-east-1a, us-east-1b).

Edge Location → For CDN (CloudFront).

AWS Pricing Models:

Pay-as-you-go, On-demand, Reserved, Spot, Savings Plans.

Pricing → On-demand, Reserved, Spot, Savings Plans.

Can attach storage (EBS, Instance store).

Auto Scaling

Automatically adjusts EC2 instances based on demand (scale in/out).

Works with CloudWatch alarms.

ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)

Distributes traffic across multiple EC2s.

Types: Application (ALB), Network (NLB), Gateway (GLB), Classic (deprecated).

Lambda (Serverless)

Event-driven serverless compute.

Pay only for execution time (ms billing).

Automatically scales.

ECS / EKS / Fargate

ECS → Container service (AWS-managed).

EKS → Kubernetes service.

Fargate → Serverless containers.

📌 Interview Questions & Answers

Q1. What is EC2?
👉 Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud (virtual servers).

Q2. What are the different pricing options for EC2?
👉

On-demand → Pay per second/hour, no commitment.

Reserved Instances → 1/3 years commitment, 70% cheaper.

Spot Instances → Bidding unused capacity, cheapest but may terminate anytime.

Savings Plans → Flexible commitment ($/hour spend).

Q3. What is Auto Scaling?
👉 Auto Scaling automatically increases or decreases the number of EC2 instances based on traffic or load metrics. It helps with cost optimization and availability.

Q4. What is the difference between Load Balancer types in AWS?
👉

Application Load Balancer (ALB) → Works at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS). Used for microservices, routing.

Network Load Balancer (NLB) → Works at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP). Ultra-low latency, high throughput.

Gateway Load Balancer (GLB) → Deploys and scales 3rd party appliances (firewalls).

Classic Load Balancer → Old, limited features.

Q5. What is AWS Lambda?
👉 A serverless compute service where you just upload code, and AWS runs it when triggered (e.g., S3 upload, API Gateway request, DynamoDB stream). Pay only for execution time, no server management.

Q6. Difference between EC2 and Lambda?
👉

EC2 → Long-running servers, full control, you manage scaling.

Lambda → Serverless, short-lived tasks, automatic scaling, cheaper for event-driven workloads.

Q7. What is ECS, EKS, and Fargate?
👉

ECS → AWS-managed container orchestration service.

Great 👍 let’s move on to the next one:

🔹 Topic 5: AWS Networking
📌 Theory

Networking is the backbone of AWS.

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

Your private network inside AWS.

You define IP ranges (CIDR), subnets, route tables.

Subnets

Public subnet → Accessible from the internet (via Internet Gateway).

Private subnet → Internal-only, no direct internet access (use NAT Gateway for outbound).

Internet Gateway (IGW)

Connects VPC to the public internet.

NAT Gateway

Allows private subnets to access the internet (for updates, downloads) without being exposed.

Security Group (SG) vs Network ACL (NACL)

SG → Instance-level firewall (stateful).

NACL → Subnet-level firewall (stateless).

Route53

AWS DNS service.

Supports routing policies (simple, weighted, latency-based, failover, geolocation).

Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)

Distribute traffic across EC2 instances.

Types: ALB, NLB, GLB (covered earlier in Compute).

📌 Interview Questions & Answers

Q1. What is a VPC?
👉 A Virtual Private Cloud is a logically isolated section of AWS where you launch resources. You define IP range, subnets, route tables, security.

Q2. Difference between Public and Private subnet?
👉

Public Subnet → Has route to Internet Gateway → resources are accessible from internet (e.g., web servers).

Private Subnet → No direct route to Internet Gateway → resources not directly accessible (e.g., databases).

Q3. Difference between Security Groups and NACLs?
👉

Security Groups → Instance-level, stateful (if inbound allowed, outbound auto-allowed).

NACLs → Subnet-level, stateless (must explicitly allow inbound & outbound).

Q4. How does a NAT Gateway work?
👉 NAT Gateway allows private subnet instances to initiate outbound connections to the internet, but prevents inbound connections from internet.

Q5. What is Route53 used for?
👉 AWS’s DNS service. It translates domain names into IP addresses, supports routing policies like:

Simple → One record.

Weighted → Traffic split by % weight.

Latency-based → Route to region with lowest latency.

Failover → Active-passive failover setup.

Q6. What are the types of Load Balancers in AWS?
👉

ALB (Application) → Layer 7, routes based on URL/host headers.

NLB (Network) → Layer 4, ultra-low latency, TCP/UDP traffic.

GLB (Gateway) → Deploy/scale 3rd-party appliances (firewalls, monitoring).

Q7. What is the difference between IGW and NAT Gateway?
👉

Internet Gateway (IGW) → Enables inbound/outbound internet traffic for public subnets.

NAT Gateway → Enables outbound internet traffic only for private subnets.

✅ That wraps up Networking.

👉 Shall I continue to Security & IAM (users, roles, policies, CloudTrail, KMS, etc.) next?

You said:

ChatGPT said:

Perfect 👍 let’s continue with the next critical one:

🔹 Topic 6: Security & IAM
📌 Theory

AWS security is mainly managed with Identity & Access Management (IAM) and supporting services:

IAM (Identity & Access Management)

Manages users, groups, roles, and policies.

IAM User → Represents a person/app, has credentials.

IAM Role → Temporary permissions assumed by AWS services or federated users.

IAM Group → Collection of users (e.g., Admins, Developers).

Policy → JSON document defining permissions (allow/deny).

KMS (Key Management Service)

Manages encryption keys.

Supports data encryption at rest and in transit.

CloudTrail

Tracks API calls & actions across AWS (audit & compliance).

CloudWatch

Monitoring and logging (metrics, alarms, dashboards).

Shared Responsibility Model

AWS → Responsible for security of the cloud (infrastructure).

Customer → Responsible for security in the cloud (apps, data, configs).

📌 Interview Questions & Answers

Q1. What is IAM in AWS?
👉 IAM (Identity & Access Management) allows you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. It controls who can do what in AWS.

Q2. Difference between IAM User and IAM Role?
👉

IAM User → Permanent identity with credentials (username, password, access keys).

IAM Role → Temporary identity without long-term credentials; assumed by users, services, or applications.

Q3. What is the Principle of Least Privilege?
👉 Always grant only the minimum permissions required to perform a task — nothing more. Improves security.

Q4. Difference between IAM Policy and Bucket Policy?
👉

IAM Policy → Attached to users/roles, defines what they can access.

Bucket Policy → Attached to S3 bucket, defines who can access the bucket.

Q5. Difference between Security Groups and IAM?
👉

Security Groups → Control network-level access (firewall rules).

IAM → Controls identity-level access (who can access which AWS service).

Q6. What is the difference between CloudTrail and CloudWatch?
👉

CloudTrail → Records API calls/events (audit & compliance). Example: “Who created this EC2?”

CloudWatch → Monitors metrics, logs, alarms (performance & operational monitoring). Example: “EC2 CPU usage is 85%.”

Q7. What is AWS KMS used for?
👉 AWS Key Management Service is used to create and manage encryption keys for encrypting data at rest and in transit.
